# Overview

A simple (likely naive) application loop in Python.


## Testing

A _very_ basic PyGame-based application is used to test the GraphicalApplication class, which in turns tests the Application class.

### Setup

It is recommended to setup a virtual Python environment (the `.test` directory is included in the [ignored entries](.gitignore) for this purpose).

After such is ready, the following command should be sufficient in preparing the environment for testing:

    pip install pygame

Since there .. really isn't many requirements, it feels .. excessive to drop a `requirements.text` file.. yet.
